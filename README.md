Homework 5

The theme for my trivia game is Back to the Future. I created an intro animation with the logo and theme song, but there is a "skip intro" button should the player wish to skip the intro.

10 random questions are chosen at the start of the game. They player is shown 1 question at a time with 4 answers to choose from. When the player selects an answer, the game notifies the player if they were right or wrong and displays an image of the correct answer. The game continues to move to the next question until the player has answered all questions. The game shows the results and displays a button to play again.

If the player chooses to play again, a new set of 10 questions is chosen. There are 20 questions total to choose from.
